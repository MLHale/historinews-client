·UNCLE SAM is the heaviest egg eat-.
er in the world. In fact. so f<md. is
the old U. S. A. Qf the hen product
that another century may see the
'deposition of the bald-headed eagle
and t'he. crowning ot another feathered monarch.
These United States eat 154,000,000
eggs each day-1,080,OOO,OOO a week
-4,620,000,000 a. month-56,160,OOO,-

a year:
Every mim, woman and .child in the country consumes a little over an egg and a. half eacb. day.
If
you, llersonally dislike eggs for food there is some one
else in some part of America who puts three away as
a' foundatio'Q for his or her breakfast coffee.
Easter week, the bigge5t egg occasion the year
'round;"sees the consumption of about two blllion eggs
~violet, piilk, crimson, purple, yellow and some green.
That the egg will displace all others as the national
food tidbit is the prognostication of those who earn
their livings by raising chickens. Chicago, alone, with
less than two million population, Easter week last, put
away 60,000,000 eggs. So greedy was the Wiudy city
llbout this llrticle of diet that lots of other portions of
th~ United States which secure th.:;:;: allotment of llen

READY FOR SH/PJ'I1fIYT

fruit from the market at the city by the lake had
to go eggless Easter.
.
Jim Patten's wheat corner will be a mere bagatelle alongside of the movement of the man who'
,can corner eggs. Small egg corners are frequent,
however. Cold storage men often lay aside several miUions in a semi-frozen state and hold them
for nine months or so, dumping them on the market when the price is in the clOUds.
I But the cold storage egg is inferior because
the fresh egg advocate argues the chicklet has
a chance to grow a little'before the yellow inside
freezes, thus storing up 'nasal evidence against
the purity of the prod'Uct.
- For the .housewife in ilie big city there is an
everyday opportunity to effect a coup, for when
she can find a producer who sells "eggs laid fresh
to-day," she considers herself a model of wifely
devotion_ But as there is DO smell on the outside
of the sheH. there are often lots of angry glances
from the male 'partner in the household, which
are born of the unborn {)hick.,
.
'rhe length of time iliat an egg wm keep1fresh
is governed by the care which is taken in its
'preservation, They a-re packed in ice as a rule,
'and if packed soon enough after being laid, the
chicken life is properly lolled and thus the angry eye-to-eye message is eliminated.
'
Suitable to the occasion is the aged tale of the
man with the flowing mustache and the timemarked egg. He had it for breakfast-tlie' eggand being a city man rode ,down to his place of
business in convent1onal m~nner, taking no notlee of' the fact that while the seat beside him
remained vacant there were half a dozen commuters'standing nearby.
As he alighted at his destination a sniff likened
to the odor of an egg. of evil intentions pierced
his nasal sense. DurIng the walk to his office
he noticed that the smell was everywhere. It'.
'was in the street, in the rotunda of the office
'building, in the elevator, in 'the hall on the nineteenth 11001', and he was startled beyond meas.ure to" find that on entering his !lffice he smelled
egg there, too_

Whispering Smith smiled. "I've got
no authority to kill McCloud."
"There are plenty of men In the
mountains that don't need any,"
"But let's start fair," urged Whispering Smith, softly. He leaned forward with one finger extended in confidence. "Don't let us have any misunderstanding on the start. Let McCloud alone. If he is killed--now I'm

Sinclair.
"Otbers?" echoed 1Vhispering Smith,

"May look out for themselves."
"Of COIll'Se, of cOU1'se! Well, if this

"You will be sorry if you mix in a

"Why, Murray, I never had a quarrel with a man in my life."

Smith felt his heart leap. He sat in
his chair turning the pack slowly, but
with only one hand now; the other
hand was free. Sinclair eyed him
sidewise. Smith moistened his lips
and when he replied spoke slowly:

Sinclair sat down and put his hands
on the table. "No; your matter and
mine is another affair. All I want be·
tween you and me is fair and right."
Whispering Smith's eyes were on
the cards. "You've always had it."
"Then keep away from her."
"Don't tell 111e what to do."
"Then don·t tell me."
