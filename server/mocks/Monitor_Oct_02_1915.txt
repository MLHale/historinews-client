As the pr'essure of the vehicle is outward, the outer wheels press harder
on the ground or rails than the inner,
and the vehicle ov·erturns upon the
outer wheels as a center. Thus the
inner wheels must leave the ground
first.
C. O. W. asks: Are all living celis
necessarily .;err.ns? Could a bon-e cell
or a tissue cell properly be called a
germ? .In other words ,do the two
words, cell and germ. have exactly
the same meaning? A. A germ is a
cell with Deculiar possibilities, If fertilized, it develops into an embryo,
and becomes finally like the parent
from which it originally came. A cell
from a piece of bone bas no such pas·
sibilities. If a bone is injured the
cells adjacent to the injury do not
propagate other bone cells and thus

You can't go much on folks who git

An' cl~im they knE'w when they "cum

Their sins wuz washed away.
1,\·1' when they git excited
An' their blood gits overhet,
ll's [('n to one they'll say sum things
Tlwy afterwards regret.
Tlwy ain't no sense in jumpin' round
An' shoutin' lil,e you're mad,
Thpy's sanpr ways of showin' that
I With all lh' worllil. you're glad.
J\I1' too it dOf'sn't matter much
